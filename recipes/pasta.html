            it does take a bit of time for the pasta to get ready.

        <h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
                <li>Pasta</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Italian Sausage</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
                <li>Herbs</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
        <ol>
                <li>Boil the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add pasta and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm), about 8-10 minutes, or according to package directions. Drain well and set aside.</li>
                <li>Cook the sausage. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large pot (or 4 qt. Dutch oven) for 2 minutes over medium-high heat until the hot oil sizzles. Add sausage and stir to cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Use a spatula to break the sausages into small pieces. Add onions and garlic and sauté until soft and tender, about 2-3 minutes. Stir to combine.       
                </li>
                <li>Make the sauce. Pour in tomato sauce, turn the heat down to medium, and bring the meat sauce to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Stir in Italian seasoning, ½ cup Parmesan cheese, parsley and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Simmering helps develop richer flavour in the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add the pasta. Transfer the cooked and drained pasta into the sauce and toss well to mix evenly.</li>
                <li>Assemble. Spread half of the pasta into a 9x13 casserole pan and top with half of mozzarella cheese (1.5 cups). Add the remaining pasta and sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese evenly on top.
                </li>
                <li>Bake. Bake the pasta in a 375F preheated oven for 25 minutes until the melted cheese is golden brown. Let cool for 15 minutes, then serve.
